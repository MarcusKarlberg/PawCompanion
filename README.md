# PawCompanion

This app guides new dog owners to give their new companions the right amount of exercise and nutrition. Based on the information provided about the dog, the app will send notifications reminding the owner when it’s time to go for a walk or when it’s time to feed the dog. The notifications also gives the owner a recommended walking distance or meal portion depending on the age and breed.

This app is also useful for those thinking about getting a dog. The app will give you a feel for what it’s like taking care of a dog, to see if you or your kids are ready for one.
